We're going to talk about the temperature sensor known as KY 001. This is a module itself So let's get started. 
This module has integrated
input a temperature sensor called Dallas 18 B 20. With single bass
technology, a resistor and a led the resistor used in this module is 4.7
kilo ohm and the main reason for using their resistor is to low mid
current circulating inside the module.
