Active Buzzer is the slightly taller one, with a solid, plastic coat on the bottom and a label that says to remove it after washing.

Only requires an external DC voltage to make it sound (batteries or USB from Arduino)

An active buzzer has a built-in oscillating source, so it will make sounds when electrified.

Can turn it on or off to make various sounds

You can use a 100 Î© resistor with it but its optional.
